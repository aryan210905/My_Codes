The distant hum of the city blended with the chirping of crickets, creating a peaceful symphony of the night. She took a deep breath, letting the crisp evening air fill her lungs. It had been a long day, but in this quiet moment, everything felt just right. The world slowed down, and for a little while, she simply existedâ€”no worries, no deadlines, just the soft glow of the streetlights and the warmth of her cup. This is India
